# Python 3 and Java algorithmic tasks

Tasks from the course "Introduction to Artificial Intelligence".

1.State space search
---
- **Python 3**
- graph search algorithms in a 2D maze: Random Search, DFS, BFS, Greedy Search, Dijkstra, A* (A Star)
- input is different maps with start and end point(maps are in 1_assignment/dataset directory)
- to run: navigate to directory `1_assignment` and run: `python3 main.py`

2.Genetic algorithm (in a graph)
---
- **Java 8** - we received java framework(that provide GUI) and we programmed functions regarding Genetic algorithm
- minimum vertex cover - searching for vertexes that fulfill vertex cover with the least vertices possible
- to run: open 2_assignment as a project in Netbeans and run from here or in bash by JDK 8(source code file path: "2_assignment\src\bi\zum\lab3")

3.Minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning
---
- **Python 3**
- minimax with pruning on the Tic-Tac-Toe game
- playable vs. computer
- to run: navigate to directory `3_assignment` and run: `python3 main.py`

Genetic algorithm - distinguish characters from the image
---
- **Python 3**
- a genetic algorithm that searches for quintuplet points in 16x16 images of characters that can distinguish specific characters
as much as possible
- various advanced methods of the genetic algorithm were used (fitness sharing, island model, catastrophe, elitism, etc.)
- to run: navigate to directory `Semestral` and run: `python3 main.py`
